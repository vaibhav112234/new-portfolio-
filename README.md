<p>1.Ensure the Backend is Running
Make sure your backend (Node.js server) is running locally or deployed. If it's running locally, it might be on http://localhost:3000 or another port that you've configured.</p>
<p>2.Open Postman
<p>3.Create a New POST Request
Open Postman and create a new POST request.
In the URL field, enter the endpoint for sending the emails. For local development, it will be:
http://localhost:8000/email/send-email </p>
<p>4.Set Up the Request Body > body>raw>json </p>
<p>5. Now, enter the JSON body like this: 
{
  "recipients": "user1@example.com, user2@example.com, user3@example.com"
}
Make sure to replace the email addresses with actual ones that you want to test with (e.g., use your own test email addresses). </p>

<p>6.Send the Request
  Click the Send button in Postman. </p>
<p>7.Check the Response
  If everything is set up correctly, you should receive a 200 OK response with a message like:
  {
    "message": "Emails sent successfully"
  }
</p>
